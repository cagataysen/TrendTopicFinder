# TrendTopicFinder
In this project worked with algorithms and data structures to find most common 10 words fastly from large tweet list.

Seperated all dates, username, times by string functions and read the .csv file with hash table, then wrote most common 10 words as an output. Also avoided from conjunctions and punctuations. 

Used C++ because project goal was being fast. So we didnt lose any time by spending to open any virtual environments and etc.
